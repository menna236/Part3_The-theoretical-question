1) Understand the Common APIs:
First, I would identify the common APIs used across both web and mobile platforms, such as order creation and product search in an e-commerce application.
2) Integrate APIs into web/mobile Test Cases to Replace UI Steps Where Possible:
I would integrate the APIs into my test cases to replace UI steps and speed up test execution.
Example: Rate Order Test Case – Instead of creating an order through the UI, I would use the API to create the order. Then, I’d rate the order from the web or mobile UI. This speeds up test execution and
allows me to focus on testing the core functionality (rating the order).
3) Integrate APIs for More Reliable Testing:
I would also use the API to ensure more reliable testing of the functionality.
Example: Add Item from Search results to Cart – I would first call the search API to retrieve results and confirm that data is returned. If results exist, I would then select the search result item from the UI
and add it to the cart. This ensures the test is more reliable, as I’m validating search results via the API before interacting with the UI.
